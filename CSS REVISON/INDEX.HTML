<p><b>1.</b>What is CSS?</p>
<ul>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</ul>
<ul>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</ul>
<ul>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</ul>
<ul>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</ul>

<p><b>2.</b>Why Use CSS?</p>
<Ul>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</Ul>

<p><b>2.</b>CSS Solved a Big Problem</p>
<ul>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</ul>
